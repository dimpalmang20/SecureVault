MASTER PROJECT PROMPT: SECURE WEB-BASED FILE SERVER

You are a senior backend systems engineer and full-stack architect.
Your task is to design and implement a complete, production-grade, web-based File Server system aligned with enterprise file server principles used in real organizations.

🎯 Project Goal

Build a secure, multi-user, web-based File Server that allows authenticated users to upload, download, list, delete, and manage files stored on a central server, following real-world file server concepts such as permission management, access isolation, and secure file handling.

The project must reflect the theoretical and practical understanding of file servers as described in the following references (already analyzed and incorporated):

TechTarget: File Server fundamentals

IBM: Network File System concepts

TechTarget: Server Message Block (SMB) protocol concepts

⚠️ Important:
This is NOT an SMB/NFS implementation at kernel level.
This is an application-level file server that conceptually follows SMB/NFS ideas such as:

Centralized storage

Client-server architecture

Permission control

Secure access

File isolation

Multi-user concurrency

🧱 Required Architecture
1️⃣ System Type

Web-based client–server architecture

Browser-based UI (no mobile app)

Runs locally on developer machine

Fully FREE (no paid services, no cloud)

2️⃣ Technology Stack (MANDATORY)
Backend

Language: Python 3

Framework: Flask

Server type: HTTP REST-based server

Database

SQLite

Used ONLY for:

User authentication

File metadata (file name, owner, size, upload time, path)

NOT used to store actual file data (files must be stored as binary blobs on disk)

File Storage

Local filesystem

Directory-based user isolation

Example:

storage/
 ├── users/
 │    ├── user_1/
 │    ├── user_2/
 │    └── user_3/

3️⃣ Core Functional Requirements (ALL REQUIRED)
🔐 Authentication & Security

User registration

User login

Password hashing (NO plain-text passwords)

Session-based authentication

Access control so users can only see their own files

📁 File Operations

Upload files (any type: PDF, image, text, zip, etc.)

Download files

List uploaded files

Delete files

Prevent directory traversal attacks

Enforce maximum file size limits

👥 Multi-user Support

Multiple users can use the system simultaneously

Files are strictly isolated per user

One user must NEVER access another user’s files

🧾 File Metadata Management

Store file metadata in SQLite:

filename

file size

upload timestamp

owner (user_id)

Display metadata in UI

4️⃣ UI / Frontend (IMPORTANT)

Design a clean, modern, professional UI (not fancy animations, but polished):

Login page

Register page

Dashboard page

File upload form

File list table with:

File name

Size

Upload time

Download button

Delete button

UI Tech:

HTML

CSS (clean layout)

Optional: Bootstrap (if used, keep it simple)

UI must look presentable for Zoho interview demo.

5️⃣ System Design Principles (MUST FOLLOW)

The implementation must clearly demonstrate:

Centralized file storage (as per file server definition)

Client-server separation

Permission management

Security awareness

No file indexing or content processing
(files are treated as binary blobs, like real file servers)

Scalable folder-based architecture

Separation of concerns:

routes

database

storage

templates

6️⃣ Folder Structure (MANDATORY OUTPUT)

Generate and explain this structure:

file_server/
 ├── app.py
 ├── config.py
 ├── database.db
 ├── storage/
 │    └── users/
 ├── templates/
 │    ├── login.html
 │    ├── register.html
 │    ├── dashboard.html
 ├── static/
 │    └── style.css
 └── README.md

7️⃣ Code Requirements

You MUST provide:

Complete backend code

Database schema

HTML templates

CSS styling

Comments explaining logic

Secure coding practices

⚠️ Do NOT skip code.
⚠️ Do NOT give partial snippets.
⚠️ Do NOT say “implement later”.

8️⃣ Documentation (MANDATORY)

Generate a README.md that includes:

Project overview

What is a file server (in simple words)

How this project aligns with SMB/NFS concepts

Features list

Tech stack

How to run the project step-by-step

Security considerations

Limitations

Future improvements

9️⃣ Interview & Presentation Support (MANDATORY)

Also generate:

5–7 interview explanation points

3–5 architecture justification points

5 common questions Zoho might ask with answers

One 1-minute project explanation script

🔟 Output Rules (VERY IMPORTANT)

Deliver the project end-to-end

No placeholders

No missing files

No “TODO”

Everything must work together

Assume the user is a final-year student, not an expert

Keep explanations simple but professional

✅ Final Objective

The final output should be something that:

Can be completed in ~10 days

Can be fully demonstrated live

Shows real system design thinking

Matches Zoho’s expectations

Is 100% free

Is resume + interview ready
